## Setup And Initialization

### API Configuration

1. **Configure the API:**

   - Open MS SQL Server and create a database named "ProjeX".
   - Navigate to `/ProjeX-API/ProjeX-API` and create a `.env` file.
   - Inside the `.env` file, add this entry:
     ```plaintext
     TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=cc7e0d44fd473002f1c42167459001140ec6389b7353f8088f4d9a95f2f596f2
     ```
     (This secret is used to hash the tokens by the API; you can use any token secret, just ensure it's the same across the frontend and backend).
   - Navigate to `appsettings.json` and change the server name in the default connection object to your SQL Server name.
   - Open NuGet Package Manager and run the migrations on the database using:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```
   - Run the API server.

2. **Configure the frontend:**

   - Open the `ProjeX-React` folder in VS Code.
   - Install all required packages by running:
     ```bash
     npm i
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of `ProjeX-React` and add the following entries:
     ```plaintext
     VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:7114
     VITE_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=cc7e0d44fd473002f1c42167459001140ec6389b7353f8088f4d9a95f2f596f2
     ```
   - Run the React server using:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

3. **Running the Project:**

   - Run the API using Visual Studio.
   - Run the React app using the command:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Enjoy :D the project should be working now.

## Notes And Missing Features

This project is currently incomplete and is missing the following features:

- Edit and delete options are not available yet for some entities like task cards, user accounts, etc.
- Task cards should be movable between categories using the mouse, but this feature is not yet implemented.
- Sessions currently rely on tokens saved in local storage, which is not the most secure and is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Using HttpOnly cookies would be a more secure approach.
